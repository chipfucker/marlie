# Terminology

I like to use special terminology to refer to things that would normally be
generic or otherwise a mouthful.

This isn't necessarily for you to use (but I will kiss you (on the lips!) if you
do), this is only here as a reference for *me.*

## Marlie

*Marlie* is the name of the bot, derieved from the artist that animated
beatbangers of the Zoologist.

## Boomerang

The *Boomerang* refers to activity revolving [throwing or
catching](#throwcatch) items between [spaces](#space).

### Throw/Catch

To *throw* an item is to send the item to another space.

To *catch* an item is to receive an item from another space.

### Space

A *space* refers to an area where the Boomerang may be found useful, such as a
Discord channel, folder, software, or wherever items may be thrown or caught.

### Basket

A *basket* is the place to find items that have been caught on the applicable
space, such as [the repository's `basket` folder.](../basket/)

> [!NOTE]
> If an area used to catch is also used to throw, such as a Discord channel,
> such should be labelled as a Boomerang, not as a basket.
